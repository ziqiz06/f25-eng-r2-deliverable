          The animal kingdom is full of speedsters, from the lightning-fast cheetah to the surprisingly swift pronghorn antelope.
           But not all animals are built for speed—herbivores, omnivores, and carnivores have evolved different strategies for survival,
           and their top velocities reflect their lifestyles. Carnivores often rely on bursts of speed to catch prey, while herbivores
           may need to outrun predators, and omnivores fall somewhere in between. The graph below compares the velocities of various animals,
            grouped by their dietary category, to reveal fascinating patterns in nature’s race for survival.
